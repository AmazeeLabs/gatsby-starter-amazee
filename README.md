## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli) to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the Amazee starter
    gatsby new my-project https://github.com/AmazeeLabs/gatsby-starter-amazee
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-project/
    yarn mocks &
    yarn develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-project` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1.  **Review the TODO's:**

    After creation the project is full of `TODO` comments that will lead you to different parts that can/have to be
    modified and also point you to external documentation on these.
